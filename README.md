# Hotel-Booking-Data-Analysis-Python

This project is a personal exploration of hotel booking data using Python. I built it to demonstrate my ability to work with real-world datasets, uncover meaningful insights, and communicate findings clearly through code and visualizations.

## Project Summary

The notebook walks through a full exploratory data analysis (EDA) process. It focuses on understanding booking patterns, cancellation behavior, and customer trends from a dataset of hotel reservations between 2015 and 2017.

## What I Did

- Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis
- Explored relationships between variables like lead time, length of stay, and cancellation status
- Created visualizations to highlight seasonal trends and customer behavior
- Used correlation matrices and frequency tables to support deeper insights
- Documented the process in a structured and readable notebook

## Key Insights

- About 37 percent of bookings were canceled
- Cancellations were more common with longer lead times and shorter stays
- Certain deposit types and customer segments had higher cancellation rates
- Family bookings tended to have longer stays and lower cancellation rates

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Plotly Express
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

The dataset includes booking details such as arrival dates, length of stay, number of guests, room types, and cancellation status. It was originally published by researchers in Portugal and later cleaned for analysis.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install required packages:  
   `pip install pandas plotly`  
3. Open the notebook file in Jupyter  
4. Run the cells and explore the analysis

## Why I Built This

I wanted to showcase my skills in data analysis, storytelling, and visualization. This project reflects how I approach data problemsâ€”from cleaning and exploration to insight generation and presentation.
